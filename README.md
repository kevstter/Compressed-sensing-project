# Compressed-sensing-project

Files related to the project I did for the compressed sensing class I took during my masters.

These are separated into two categories, the writeup, and the codes. 

Under 'Project - final version' is the writeup. This contains the pdf files and the tex document. As is, the tex document cannot be compiled. Missing are the figures and bib file.

Under 'Project codes' are a number of Matlab codes.
